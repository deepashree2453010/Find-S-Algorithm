This repository contains the implementation and documentation of the Find-S Algorithm using a reduced Bank Marketing dataset. The objective of this experiment is to understand concept learning by identifying the most specific hypothesis that describes customers who subscribe to a term deposit. The project includes the dataset, experiment PDF, and related files, and demonstrates how the Find-S algorithm generalizes attributes based only on positive training examples.
